# City Scape Splash

This is an animated city scape splash screen based on [City Pixels Loading by Smokey](https://github.com/smokey5787/city-pixels-loading/).

## Installation

Copy the entire `city-pixels-loading-anim` folder into `~/.local/share/plasma/look-and-feel`. After doing this, it should appear within the Splash Screen page of System Settings.

## How

I wrote a C# application to generate the city skyline and generate loopable animation frames, which I then encoded with FFMPEG. This can be found here:

The rest was all image manipulation and writing markup.
